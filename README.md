         The system ensures that all records are securely stored and easily accessible to authorized personnel, facilitating smooth and efficient barangay operations while maintaining data integrity.
     Scope
         This study was focused on the development of BrgyGo, an application and  web-based system designed to enhance barangay management by improving information accessibility and simplifying record-keeping for Brgy. Burgos, Tuy, Batangas.
         The system is primarily intended for barangay officials, administrators, and residents, where the administrator manages user access, community profiles, monitors resident information, and ensures that the system functions smoothly, 
         equipping them with digital tools to efficiently store, update, and retrieve vital records, such as residents' profiles, certifications, clearances, and other barangay records.
